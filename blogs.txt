How to Get a YouTube Channel Monetized? The Eligibility Requirements and Application Process for the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)
Introduction to YouTube Monetization
In today’s digital age, turning your creativity into a steady stream of income is no longer a distant dream. One of the most accessible ways to do that is through YouTube. But how exactly does one monetize a YouTube channel? And what are the steps involved in joining the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?
Monetization means you're earning money from the content you upload on YouTube. It usually begins when ads appear on your videos—but it can go much further with features like memberships, Super Chats, and more.
For content creators, this marks a major milestone. But before you can start earning, you need to meet certain requirements and go through a detailed application process. Let’s break it all down so you can start your journey toward becoming a paid YouTuber.

What is the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?
The YouTube Partner Program is a way for content creators to earn money from their videos. Once you’re accepted into YPP, you unlock access to monetization features such as:
Running ads on your videos


Earning revenue from YouTube Premium subscribers


Channel memberships


Super Chat and Super Stickers during live streams


This program is YouTube’s way of rewarding creators who provide consistent, engaging, and policy-abiding content.

YouTube Monetization Eligibility Requirements
To be eligible for YPP, you need to meet YouTube’s monetization threshold. You can qualify in one of two ways:
1,000 Subscribers and 4,000 Watch Hours
This is the traditional route for long-form content creators.
You’ll need:
At least 1,000 subscribers


At least 4,000 valid public watch hours in the past 12 months


These numbers ensure that your content has enough reach and that your audience is engaged. It's ideal for creators who post regular videos that are longer in duration.
Tips to reach this:
Post consistently (2–3 videos per week)


Focus on searchable content using relevant keywords


Promote your videos on social platforms


Use calls-to-action to encourage subscriptions


Alternative: 10 Million Public Shorts Views in 90 Days
If you're focusing on YouTube Shorts, there's another way.
You’ll need:
10 million public Shorts views in the last 90 days


And at least 1,000 subscribers


This route is gaining popularity with creators who post short-form content in vertical video format.
Tips to achieve this:
Post multiple Shorts per day


Use trending sounds and hashtags


Hook viewers within the first 1–2 seconds


Keep videos short, entertaining, and loopable



Step-by-Step Guide to Applying for the YouTube Partner Program
Once you meet the requirements, here’s how to apply:
Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
Go to YouTube Studio → Monetization tab. You’ll see whether you’ve met the threshold.
Step 2: Enable 2-Step Verification
Make sure your Google account has 2-step verification enabled. This adds an extra layer of security.
Step 3: Accept YPP Terms
Agree to the YouTube Partner Program Terms, which outline how you'll get paid and what policies to follow.
Step 4: Connect a Google AdSense Account
You’ll need an AdSense account to receive payments. If you don’t have one, YouTube will walk you through setting it up.
Step 5: Wait for Review
YouTube will review your channel to make sure it complies with all monetization policies. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

Understanding the Review Process
During this stage, human reviewers will assess your channel content. They'll look at your:
Video uploads


Channel metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails)


Community engagement


Approval usually takes 1–3 weeks.
If you're rejected, don’t panic! You’ll receive feedback and can reapply in 30 days after making improvements.

Key YouTube Monetization Policies and Guidelines
To stay in YPP, your content must follow these rules:
YouTube Community Guidelines (no harmful, violent, or hateful content)


Copyright laws (avoid using unlicensed music or footage)


AdSense Program Policies (no click fraud or misleading ads)

How Much Does YouTube Pay Per 1000 Views? Understanding RPM (Revenue Per Mille) and the Factors Influencing Earnings
Introduction to YouTube Earnings
Making money on YouTube isn’t just a dream for content creators—it’s a legitimate business model that rewards creativity, consistency, and strategy. One of the most common questions from new YouTubers is: "How much does YouTube pay per 1000 views?" The answer isn’t straightforward because it depends on something called RPM (Revenue Per Mille).
While it’s easy to assume a flat rate for all views, YouTube's monetization is influenced by a variety of factors such as content type, audience location, watch time, and more. Let's dive into RPM and uncover how much you can actually earn.

What Is RPM (Revenue Per Mille)?
RPM stands for "Revenue Per Mille," which translates to revenue per 1,000 views. It tells creators how much money they make for every 1,000 monetized views after YouTube’s cut and accounting for all revenue sources.
RPM = (Total Revenue / Total Views) × 1000
This includes:
Ad revenue


Channel memberships


Super Chat/Super Stickers


YouTube Premium revenue


So, RPM gives a more accurate picture of what you actually earn—not just from ads, but from all monetization streams combined.

RPM vs. CPM vs. CPC Explained
Many new creators confuse RPM with CPM and CPC. Here's how they differ:
Term
Definition
Who It Applies To
RPM
Creator’s earnings per 1000 views
Content creators
CPM (Cost Per Mille)
Advertiser’s cost per 1000 ad impressions
Advertisers
CPC (Cost Per Click)
Advertiser’s cost when a viewer clicks on an ad
Advertisers & YouTube

Key takeaway: RPM reflects your actual earnings after YouTube’s 45% cut, while CPM is what advertisers are willing to pay.

Average RPM Rates on YouTube
The average RPM on YouTube varies significantly depending on several factors, but here are rough estimates:
Content Type
Average RPM
Finance / Investing
$8 – $20+
Tech / Reviews
$4 – $10
Health / Wellness
$3 – $7
Education
$2 – $6
Vlogs / Entertainment
$1 – $4
Gaming
$0.50 – $2.50

These figures represent global averages and fluctuate over time.

RPM by Country and Region
Audience location plays a major role in RPM. Creators with viewers from high-income countries like the USA, UK, Canada, and Australia tend to have higher RPMs.
Country
Estimated RPM Range
United States
$2 – $12
Canada
$1.50 – $10
India
$0.25 – $1.50
Philippines
$0.20 – $1.00
Germany
$2 – $8

If your audience is mostly from lower-paying regions, your RPM may be lower even if your content is high quality.

Key Factors That Influence RPM and Earnings
Several elements affect how much you earn per 1000 views:
Audience Demographics: Older, employed viewers attract higher-paying ads.


Video Length: Videos over 8 minutes allow mid-roll ads, boosting revenue.


Engagement: Higher likes, comments, and CTR (Click-Through Rate) lead to better ad placements.


Content Category: Financial or educational content generally earns more.


Seasonality: Advertisers spend more during Q4 (holiday season), increasing RPM.



How to Calculate Your Estimated YouTube Income
You can use this simple formula:
Estimated Income = (Total Views ÷ 1000) × RPM
Example:
Views: 200,000


RPM: $4
 Estimated Income: (200,000 ÷ 1,000) × $4 = $800


Use YouTube Analytics to find your actual RPM in the Revenue tab.

What Is a Good CTR on YouTube? Benchmarks and What to Aim for in Different Niches
Understanding CTR (Click-Through Rate) on YouTube
If you're serious about growing a successful YouTube channel, understanding Click-Through Rate (CTR) is essential. CTR reflects how effective your titles and thumbnails are in getting viewers to click on your video when it's shown to them. In simple terms, it measures how clickable your content is.
A high CTR means your video is appealing and grabbing attention. A low CTR might signal that viewers aren’t intrigued by your title or thumbnail—even if the content itself is excellent.

How YouTube Calculates CTR
CTR is calculated as:
CTR (%) = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100
For example, if your video was shown (impressed) to 10,000 people and 700 clicked to watch, your CTR would be 7%.
You can find CTR data in YouTube Studio → Content → Analytics → Reach.

What Is Considered a Good CTR on YouTube?
So, what’s a “good” CTR? It depends on several variables, but here are some general benchmarks:
CTR Range
Interpretation
Below 2%
Needs significant improvement
2% – 4%
Average or slightly below
4% – 6%
Solid performance
6% – 10%
Very good CTR
10%+
Exceptional (rare & usually short-lived)

Keep in mind, a high CTR combined with low watch time may indicate clickbait content.

YouTube’s Official CTR Guidelines
According to YouTube, most videos average a CTR between 2% and 10%. Fluctuations are normal depending on how and where impressions are generated—home feed, search, suggested, etc.

CTR Benchmarks Across Different Niches
CTR can vary widely by niche, due to differences in competition and viewer behavior. Here’s what to expect:
Niche
Average CTR Range
Vlogging
3% – 6%
Gaming
2.5% – 5%
Tech Reviews
4% – 7%
Finance / Investing
5% – 9%
Education / Tutorials
4% – 8%
Comedy & Entertainment
3% – 6%

Finance and educational content tend to perform better due to higher search intent, while gaming and entertainment niches face more competition.

Factors That Influence CTR
Several variables impact your CTR:
Thumbnail quality: Clear, vibrant, emotional faces, or intriguing visuals


Title appeal: Keywords + emotional triggers (e.g., “how to,” “why,” “shocking”)


Relevance: How well your topic matches viewer intent


Traffic source: CTR from search vs. suggested vs. external sources

How to Choose a Niche for a YouTube Channel? Strategies for Finding a Profitable and Passionate Content Area
Introduction to Choosing a YouTube Niche
Launching a YouTube channel is exciting, but if you want it to grow, the very first decision—your niche—can make or break your success. Your niche determines your target audience, video topics, branding, and monetization opportunities.
Choosing a clear niche builds trust with viewers. When people know exactly what kind of content to expect from your channel, they’re more likely to subscribe and keep watching. So how do you choose a niche that’s both profitable and personally fulfilling?

What Is a YouTube Niche?
A YouTube niche is a focused category or theme that defines the type of content you consistently produce. Instead of making random videos, a niche channel sticks to a specific topic, like:
Tech Reviews


Personal Finance for Beginners


Minimalist Living


Plant-Based Recipes


Educational Math Tutorials


Niche channels are easier to grow because they attract a consistent, loyal audience. They also perform better with the YouTube algorithm.

The Importance of Niche Selection
Choosing a niche helps you:
Build a brand faster


Rank higher in YouTube search and recommendations


Monetize efficiently, as advertisers prefer targeted content


However, going too broad—like covering fitness, gaming, and cooking all on one channel—can confuse your audience and hurt your growth.

Balancing Passion and Profitability
The sweet spot is where your passion intersects with a profitable demand.
Many creators pick something they love, but if there’s no audience interest or ad revenue potential, they struggle to grow. Others chase high-paying niches like finance or tech but burn out from lack of interest.

(To be placed right here for visual clarity)

Step-by-Step Strategy for Finding the Right Niche
Identify Your Strengths and Interests
 What do you love talking about? What skills or experiences do you have?


Research Demand
 Use tools like Google Trends and YouTube Search to see if people are actively searching for your topic.


Analyze the Competition
 Are there big players already? Can you offer something different?


Validate the Niche
 Make 3–5 videos and check performance, engagement, and your own motivation.



How to Use Keyword Tools to Discover Niche Potential
Tools like:
TubeBuddy and VidIQ – show search volume, competition score, and channel opportunities


Google Trends – helps compare interest over time


YouTube Autocomplete – reveals what people are actively searching for
