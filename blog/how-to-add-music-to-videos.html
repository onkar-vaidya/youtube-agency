                    <p>Music can transform the mood and energy of your videos, but using the wrong track can lead to copyright strikes, demonetization, or even video removal. This guide will show you how to safely find and use high-quality music in your YouTube content.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Copyright on YouTube</h2>
                    <p>You cannot use music from popular artists in your videos without obtaining a specific, often expensive, license. YouTube's Content ID system automatically scans videos to detect copyrighted material. If it finds a match, the copyright holder can claim your video, which can result in several penalties.</p>

                    <h2>The Best Sources for Royalty-Free Music</h2>
                    <p>"Royalty-free" doesn't mean the music is free of cost; it means you don't have to pay ongoing royalties for its use. Here are the best places to find it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>YouTube Audio Library:</strong> This is the best place to start. Inside your <a href="what-is-youtube-studio.html">YouTube Studio</a>, you'll find a massive library of high-quality music and sound effects that are completely free and safe to use in your monetized videos.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subscription Services (Paid):</strong> Platforms like Epidemic Sound and Artlist offer huge catalogs of incredible music for a monthly fee. This is the go-to choice for most professional creators as it provides the highest quality and variety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creative Commons Music (Free with Attribution):</strong> Some websites offer music under a Creative Commons license, which means it's free to use as long as you credit the artist in your video description. Always read the specific license terms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>How to Add Music in Your Editor</h2>
                    <p>Once you've downloaded a safe track, you can import it into your <a href="best-video-editing-software-for-youtube.html">video editing software</a>. Place it on a separate audio track and adjust the volume so it doesn't overpower your voice. Good background music should be felt, not just heard.</p>
